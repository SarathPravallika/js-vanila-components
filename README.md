Just jotted down my thoughts on the folder structure:

Each component will be a combination of the following:

(1). Plain HTML without using any extra templating libraries to be more readable
(2). Plain JS   without using any advanced frameworks to be framework agnostic
(3). Plain CSS  without using any pre-processors to eliminate the build step
(4). Unit testing at a component level be it a base (or) complex
